## Note
Let me clarify why this extension is not made using any framework. The main reason behind it is to get many ideas and contributions towards the extension.

## How to Contribute
You can simply raise an issue on how you might contribute to the project and if the issue is valid you can work on it.

## How to Use It?

Simply Download the repo or fork it for later. Now extract the downloaded file and open your favorite browser. Then move to manage extensions on your browser ([Click Here](chrome://extensions/ "Click Here") If your Browser is Chrome).

Now, Turn on the Developer mode now you can click on the load unpack button and then choose the extracted directory. Finally, you can enjoy the extension be sure to pin it. 

**Free Extension, Hell Yeah!**
